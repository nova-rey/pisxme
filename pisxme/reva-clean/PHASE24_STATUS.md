# Phase 24 acreage validation status

Status: IN PROGRESS — native ERC and netlist pass; schematic↔PCB component
parity remains open.

## Closed in this checkpoint

- The clean project now resolves all 34 custom symbols through the assembled
  `PiSXMe_RevA_Clean_complete.kicad_sym` library.
- `phase24_repair_root_hierarchy.py` generically replaces the malformed root
  interior/diagonal wiring with outward sheet-edge stubs and named root
  associations, preserving child UUIDs and sheet instances.
- The CM5 sheet border is extended where the legacy final pin was outside its
  rectangle.
- Two unused MIPI1 D2 pins are explicitly marked no-connect; they are outside
  the Rev A interface contract.
- Native KiCad 10.0.5 ERC with `--severity-error` reports `Found 0 violations`.
- `validation/phase3/test_phase24_native_final_authority.py` passes.

## Netlist closure

The warning was caused by four regulator 22 uF capacitors retaining stale
`(instances)` references C30–C33 after their symbol properties were renumbered.
`phase24_repair_duplicate_refs.py` updates both serialized representations to
C44–C47.  KiCad 10.0.5 now exports a non-empty netlist with no annotation
warning.

Artifacts: `PHASE24_NATIVE_ERC_FINAL2.rpt`, `PHASE24_NETLIST_FINAL5.xml`, and
the Phase 24 native-authority regression.

## Remaining parity repair

Fresh comparison of `PHASE24_NETLIST_FINAL5.xml` against
`PHASE23_TEST_DEBUG_PADS_V5.kicad_pcb` found schematic components with no PCB
footprint: `Y1`, `R23`, `C42`, `C43`, and `C44`–`C47`.  These are real storage
clock and regulator support components, not optional debug artifacts.  The
first disposable clock graft was rejected because its historical hard-coded
U7 clock-row coordinates produced true shorts; it is retained only as failed
evidence.  Phase 24 stays open until a coordinate-derived, native-DRC-clean
materialization and parity check are complete.
